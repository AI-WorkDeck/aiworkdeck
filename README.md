# AI Workdeck Community Edition (Kernel)

> **AI Workdeck Community Edition (Kernel) — open-source core for document workflows (AGPLv3). Commercial license available for proprietary SaaS / enterprise use.**

## 1. Project Positioning
This repository hosts the **Community Edition (Kernel)** of AI Workdeck. It provides the core open-source infrastructure for verifiable, integrable document workflow and evidence chain capabilities.

**It is NOT the full commercial SaaS product.**
We open-source this kernel to empower developers to audit, integrate, and build upon our core document processing technologies.

## 2. Intellectual Property & "Look and Feel"
**Important Notice on Project Structure & Design:**
The value of AI Workdeck lies not just in the lines of code, but in the specific **Structure, Sequence, and Organization (SSO)** of its IDE-based document workflow.

*   **Protected Expression:** We assert copyright over the unique arrangement of our "Document-as-Code" workflow, the specific orchestration of AI agents within the editor context, and the visual/functional hierarchy of the IDE panels.
*   **Anti-Cloning:** If you create a derivative work that mimics this project's unique "IDE Structure and Logic Flow"—even if you reimplement the code from scratch—we generally consider this a derivative work of our **Trade Dress** and **Creative Expression**.
*   **Good Faith:** If you are inspired by this architecture, strict compliance with the AGPLv3 is expected. If you attempt to clone the *concept* and *workflow* for a closed-source product, you are violating the spirit and potentially the letter of our IP rights.

## 3. Licensing Strategy
We believe in sustainable open source.
- **Community / Open Source Use:** You are free to use, modify, and distribute this software under the terms of the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)**.
- **Proprietary / Commercial SaaS Use:** If you wish to use this software in a closed-source SaaS environment, proprietary enterprise deployment, or distribute it without releasing your modifications, **you must obtain a Commercial License**.

This dual-licensing model ensures the project remains free for the open-source community while providing a sustainable path for commercial integrations compared to closed-source copying.

## 3. Licensing Terms

### Community Edition (AGPLv3)
The "Community Edition / Kernel" of this project is released under the **AGPLv3**.

> If you modify this program and provide it as a network service to others (typical SaaS scenario), you must provide the corresponding source code to the users of that service under the AGPLv3.

### Commercial License
If you wish to use this project for:
- Closed-source SaaS delivery
- Proprietary on-premise delivery
- Distributing as part of a commercial non-open-source product

Please [contact us to acquire a Commercial License](mailto:hi@aiworkdeck.com).

*See [LICENSE](legal/LICENSE) for the full AGPLv3 text and [COMMERCIAL-LICENSE](legal/COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md) for commercial licensing details.*

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeweihan/aiworkdeck.git
cd aiworkdeck
```

### 2. Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Docker**: Required for PPTX generation and MinerU services.
- **Java 17+**: Required for the Backend service.
- **Node.js 18+**: Required for Frontend and Desktop services.

### 3. Configuration
Copy the example configuration files to their production counterparts and fill in your API keys.

#### 3.1 Backend Configuration
Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env.production`.

> **Note**: You must have a PostgreSQL database running. This project does not provide a Docker container for the database.

### 4. Build & Run
We provide a one-click script to build and start all services (Backend, Frontend, Desktop, and Docker containers).

```bash
chmod +x restart-all.sh
./restart-all.sh
```
*Note: This script automatically checks for dependencies, stops old processes, packages the backend, and starts all services in the correct order.*

### 5. Local Access (Intranet Penetration)
If you are running this locally and need to expose it to the internet (e.g., for external API callbacks or remote access), we recommend using **cpolar**.

- **Official Website**: [https://www.cpolar.com/](https://www.cpolar.com/)

You can use cpolar to easily map your local ports (e.g., 5173 for Frontend, 9696 for Backend) to a public URL.
